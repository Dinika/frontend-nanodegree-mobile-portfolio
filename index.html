        <strong>Optimization of the critical resources of a website</strong> The major purpose of this project is to study and summarize some of the various techniques and good practices that a developer can use to build high performance website. This report builds upon the knowledge that was presented in its predecessor report (Analysis of Hyper Text Transfer Protocols and its Variants) in which a detailed study of the HTTP Request/Response cycle as well as security and performance advantages of HTTP/2.0 were explored. This report is the description of the final part of the project in which we take a deep dive into strategies that build a high performance website. <br> Paper accepted at IC4S Conference at <b> THAILAND </b>
